# Caesar-s-Cipher
-Cipher which can take text and symbols and encrypt or decrypt the text based on a shift key number (positional change in the alphabet).  
-Cipher can take any shift value, even if it is much higher than the number of letters in the alphabet. 
-Cipher will reset the program if the user asks it to. 
-Best run on Replit as the Cipher makes use of the clear() command which is imported in the code from Replit. If run on any other IDE, it will still run, just won't clear
 if asked to.
